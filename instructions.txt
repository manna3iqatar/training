col_names = ['time','body_temp_C','therm_temp','targ_temp']
Note: 
body_temp is surface body temperature of IR thermometer in deg C

voltage output of thermistor in mV

therm_temp is target temperature; calculated by adding the sensor body temperature raised to the fourth power and 
the mV output multiplied by the slope (m) and the y-intercept(b),then the fourth root of this sum
